# ShareableLink Reference Error Fix

## 🐛 Issue Identified
```
SharedQuotePage.tsx:126 Uncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: shareableLink is not defined
    at handleShare (SharedQuotePage.tsx:126:21)
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `handleShare` function in SharedQuotePage.tsx was trying to reference a variable `shareableLink` that was not defined in the component scope. The component only had access to:
- `shareId` (from URL parameters via `useParams()`)
- `booking` (from React Query cache with BookingResponse type)

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Before (Problematic Code):
```javascript
const handleShare = async () => {
  const url = shareableLink || window.location.href  // ❌ shareableLink not defined
  // ... rest of function
}
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```javascript
const handleShare = async () => {
  // Use the shareId from URL params or the shareableLink from booking data
  const shareableLink = booking?.shareableLink || shareId
  const url = shareableLink ? `${window.location.origin}/quotes/share/${shareableLink}` : window.location.href
  // ... rest of function
}
```

## 🔧 What the Fix Does

1. **Defines shareableLink locally**: Creates a local variable within the function scope
2. **Uses booking data first**: Tries to get shareableLink from the booking object (API response)
3. **Falls back to URL param**: If booking doesn't have shareableLink, uses shareId from URL
4. **Constructs proper URL**: Builds the full shareable URL with origin and path
5. **Provides fallback**: If neither is available, uses current page URL

## 🧪 Testing

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ **Share button works**: No more ReferenceError when clicking share
- ✅ **Proper URL generation**: Creates correct shareable links
- ✅ **Fallback handling**: Works even if data is missing
- ✅ **TypeScript compatibility**: No compilation errors
- ✅ **Build success**: Project builds without issues

## 🚀 Result

Users can now successfully:
1. Fill out quote form on `/quotes` page
2. Save quotation (POST to `/api/booking/`)
3. View quote on SharedQuotePage
4. **Click Share button without errors** ✅
5. Copy or share the quote link properly

The shareableLink reference error has been completely resolved and the sharing functionality now works as expected!
