## üîß Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
```
React 18.3
TypeScript 5.0
React Query (TanStack Query) - Data fetching
Shadcn UI - Component library
Tailwind CSS - Styling
date-fns - Date manipulation
Lucide React - Icons
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Local state (useState)
- selectedDate: Date
- filters: ReservationFilters
- columns: ColumnConfig[]
- editingCells: Record<string, any>
- pendingChanges: Record<string, Partial<Reservation>>
- selectedReservations: Set<string>

// Server state (React Query)
- useReservations() - All reservations with caching
- refetch() - Manual refresh trigger

// Persistent state (localStorage)
- logistics_column_preferences - Per-user column config
```

### Data Flow
```
User Opens Page
    ‚Üì
React Query fetches /api/reservations/
    ‚Üì
useMemo filters by date + status
    ‚Üì
useEffect detects conflicts
    ‚Üì
Renders table with data
    ‚Üì
User edits cell ‚Üí Local state update
    ‚Üì
User clicks Save ‚Üí API PUT request
    ‚Üì
React Query refetches ‚Üí UI auto-updates
```

## üåê Backend Requirements

### Required API Endpoints

These endpoints need to be implemented or updated on the backend:

#### 1. Get All Reservations (Already Exists ‚úÖ)
```
GET /api/reservations/
Response: Reservation[]
```

#### 2. Update Reservation (Needs Implementation ‚ö†Ô∏è)
```
PUT /api/reservations/{id}/
Body: {
  operator?: string,
  driver?: string,
  guide?: string,
  tour: {
    pickupTime?: string,
    pickupAddress?: string,
    date?: Date
  }
}
Response: Reservation
```

#### 3. Update Status (Needs Implementation ‚ö†Ô∏è)
```
PATCH /api/reservations/{id}/status/
Body: { status: 'confirmed' | 'reconfirmed' | 'completed' | 'cancelled' | 'no-show' }
Response: Reservation

Business Logic:
- When status = 'reconfirmed', validate:
  ‚úì operator is assigned
  ‚úì driver is assigned
  ‚úì guide is assigned
- Set is_locked = True for reconfirmed/completed/cancelled/no-show
```

#### 4. Get Filter Options (Needs Enhancement ‚ö†Ô∏è)
```
GET /api/reservations/filter-options/
Response: {
  drivers: User[],
  guides: User[],
  operators: string[], // NEW
  tours: Tour[]
}
```

#### 5. Generate Service Orders (New Feature ‚ö†Ô∏è)
```
POST /api/reservations/service-orders/
Body: { reservationIds: string[] }
Response: { pdfUrl: string }

Implementation:
- Generate PDF with tour details, passenger list, pickup info
- Include company branding
- Return download URL or Base64
```

#### 6. Send Confirmation Emails (New Feature ‚ö†Ô∏è)
```
POST /api/reservations/send-confirmations/
Body: { reservationIds: string[] }
Response: { sent: number, failed: number }

Implementation:
- Send email to client with tour confirmation
- Include: Tour name, date, time, pickup location, contact info
- Use email template with company branding
```

### Database Changes Required

#### Reservation Model Updates
```python
# Add new status choices
STATUS_CHOICES = [
    ('pending', 'Pending'),
    ('confirmed', 'Confirmed'),
    ('reconfirmed', 'Reconfirmed'),  # NEW
    ('completed', 'Completed'),
    ('cancelled', 'Cancelled'),
    ('no-show', 'No Show'),  # NEW
]

# Add locking field
is_locked = models.BooleanField(default=False)

# Add logistics fields (if not exists)
operator = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True, blank=True)
driver = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='driver_reservations', null=True)
guide = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='guide_reservations', null=True)
```

#### Permission Logic
```python
def can_edit(user, reservation):
    # Admin can always edit
    if user.is_staff:
        return True

    # Sales staff can only edit pending/confirmed
    if user.role == 'salesperson':
        return reservation.status in ['pending', 'confirmed'] and not reservation.is_locked

    # Logistics can edit everything except completed
    if user.role in ['logistics', 'operator']:
        return reservation.status != 'completed'

    return False
```
