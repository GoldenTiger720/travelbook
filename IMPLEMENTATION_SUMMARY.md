# BookQuotePage to SharedQuotePage Data Flow Implementation

## What Was Implemented

The BookQuotePage now properly sends POST requests to `/api/booking/` and stores the successful response in React Query cache for the SharedQuotePage to consume.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. BookQuotePage.tsx
- ✅ **Restored API POST request**: Now sends data to `/api/booking/` endpoint using `createBookingMutation.mutate()`
- ✅ **Success handling**: SweetAlert modal appears saying "Quote created successfully" after successful API response
- ✅ **Cache storage**: Successful API response is stored in React Query cache using key `['shared-quote', shareableLink]`
- ✅ **Error handling**: Proper error messages for failed API calls
- ✅ **Fixed TypeScript errors**: Corrected Date types and removed unused imports

### 2. SharedQuotePage.tsx
- ✅ **React Query integration**: Uses `useQuery` to read data from cache with key `['shared-quote', shareId]`
- ✅ **Cache-first approach**: Reads data from React Query cache instead of making separate API calls
- ✅ **Fallback handling**: Shows appropriate message if no data in cache

## How It Works

1. **User fills quote form** in BookQuotePage
2. **Clicks "Save Quotation"** button
3. **POST request sent** to `/api/booking/` with all form data
4. **API responds successfully** with booking data including `shareableLink`
5. **SweetAlert shows** "Quote created successfully" message
6. **Response stored in cache** using React Query with key `['shared-quote', shareableLink]`
7. **Navigation occurs** to `/quotes/share/{shareableLink}`
8. **SharedQuotePage loads** and reads data from React Query cache
9. **Quote displayed** with all customer info, tours, and pricing

## Benefits

- ✅ **Proper backend integration**: Data is saved to database via API
- ✅ **Fast page transitions**: No additional API calls needed when navigating to SharedQuotePage
- ✅ **Data consistency**: Same data that was sent to API is displayed on SharedQuotePage
- ✅ **Error handling**: Proper feedback for both success and failure scenarios
- ✅ **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout the flow

## API Endpoint

The implementation sends POST requests to:
```
POST /api/booking/
```

With the complete booking data including:
- Customer information
- Tour bookings
- Pricing details
- Quote settings
- Generated shareableLink

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Navigate to `/quotes` page
2. Fill out customer information and add tours
3. Click "Save Quotation" button
4. Verify POST request is sent to `/api/booking/` (check Network tab)
5. Verify SweetAlert success modal appears
6. Verify navigation to `/quotes/share/{id}` page
7. Verify all entered data is displayed correctly
8. Check browser console for debug logs

The data flow is now complete and working as requested.
