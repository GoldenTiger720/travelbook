# Complete API Data Display Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The SharedQuotePage has been fully updated to handle the real API response structure and display all data fields from the GET `/api/public/booking/{link}/` endpoint.

## 📊 API Response Structure Handled

The implementation now correctly handles the nested API response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Booking data retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    // All booking data here
  },
  "shareableLink": "1758239886015-fuhxcumhhsr",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-18T23:58:19.645678Z"
}
```
